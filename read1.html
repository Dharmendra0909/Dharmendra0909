            <p>Oh sweet cappuccinos, how I love you. Nowadays, I always buy a cappuccino. A cappuccino is made by pouring an espresso shot into a cup, then top it with steamed milk and foam in an equal ration. You should sprinkle ground chocolate on top of the foam, although I specifically ask all barista to omit this step for me.
<br>
                The reason why I love cappuccinos is because of their delicious, creamier taste. I adore milk foam too, as it creates a softer flavour when the espresso passes through it.
                <br>
                During the winter months, you will find cappuccinos topped with cinnamon powder or nutmeg on the top for a most festive taste.
                <br><br>
                Tip: in Italy, a cappuccino is a breakfast drink which shouldn't be ordered after 12 pm. Although don't worry, you will still get your brew if you order it at any time of the day.
                <br>
                
                To make cappuccino, extract one shot of espresso in a cup. Add steamed milk and 3 cm of foamed milk. Sprinkle chocolate or cinnamon on top.
                <br>
                To make vegan cappuccino, simply replace the milk with a plant-based alternative. We recommend oat milk as it yields the creamiest result in our experience.
