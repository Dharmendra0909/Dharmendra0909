            <h3>cortado</h3>
            <p>The cortado is an espresso drink with the perfect balance of milk and espresso! It's a uniquely ...<br>
                Ingredients<br>
                2 ounces* espresso (1 doubleshot)<br>
                2 ounces steamed milk (see steps)<br>
                Cortado glass or Gibraltar glass<br></p>

    The first time I encountered "cortado" on a coffee shop menu I was super confused<br> I was well versed in differences between latte and cappuccino, but a cortado? What that might be?


The reason why I was confused? Well, Cortado is not an Italian word, but Spanish! A cortado is a beverage made with one shot of espresso mixed with a roughly equal amount of steamed milk<br>

The important part to remember is that a cortado has steamed milk and not frothy or texturised in any way like in many Italian coffees<br>

You will find a cortado in many places in Spain, Portugal and Cuba<br> And if anyone asks, a cortado is the past participle of the Spanish verb "cortar" which means to cut<br> In this context, a cortado is used in the sense of diluting (cutting the drink with something)<br> This is because the milk reduces the acidity of the coffee<br>
