            <p>How to make a latte at home, including the best coffee-to-milk ratio, espresso brewing tips (even ...<br>
                Ingredients<br>
                2 oz. freshly brewed espresso (2 shots)<br>
                8 oz. whole milk (or oat milk)<br>
            <p>A latte is relatively similar to a cappuccino,<br> although the ratio of espresso, steamed milk and milk foam is different. <br><br>A latte should be served in a tumbler glass, although it is now more common to see it a regular coffee mug.<br><br>

                To create the perfect latte extract one shot of espresso, then pour steamed milk over. The latte should have a minimal amount of milk foam on top, used to create "latte art".<br><br>
                
                Latte is the Italian word for milk and in Italy, this beverage means milk coffee.<br> However, a latte is a lot more than just coffee with milk on top.<br> The steamed milk is the star attraction in a latte with just a tad bit of foam on the top.<br> Many coffee shops in the world train their baristas to create some of the most incredible latte art you can imagine.<br> There are restaurants in Tokyo which specialise in designing beautiful coffee.<br>
