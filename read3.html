            <h3>A Mocha </h3>
            
        
            <p>Skip the queues at your local coffee shop and whip up a mocha coffee at home in just a few minutes. ...<br>
                Ingredients<br>
                1/2 cup of milk ((or almond milk))<br>
                1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
                1 tablespoon honey<br>
                1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
                Â¾ cup strong brewed espresso (or regular coffee)<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                A mocha is a cross between a cappuccino and a hot chocolate.<br> If you have a sweet tooth, then this is probably your best bet. <br>You can find a mocha in a super simple form which is a shot of espresso topped with hot chocolate.<br> But the more sophisticated mocha has a shot of espresso, a small part of hot chocolate (or hot chocolate syrup), topped with steamed milk and milk foam.<br>


The idea behind a mocha is to have an extraordinarily extravagant drink. Hot chocolate should be silky and smooth and combined with the sweetness of the milk and the bitterness of the espresso, you have the perfect, most indulgent beverage.<br>

But mocha as a name can be a little confusing.<br> Mocha coffee is not the same as mocha coffee beans. <br>Mocha beans come from a place called Mocha in Yemen.<br> The funny thing is that Mocha beans are known to have a hint of chocolate.<br>

Either way, a mocha can be done with delicious chocolate powder or syrup or can become a gorgeous white mocha, made with white chocolate instead.<br>

To make the perfect mocha, extract one shot of espresso into a cup.<br> Add one spoon of chocolate powder into the espresso and mix. <br>Top it up with steamed milk and around 3 cm of milk foam.<br> If you like, you can sprinkle chocolate powder on top. Yum!<br>
