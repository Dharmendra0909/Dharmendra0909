            <h3>macchiato</h3>
            <p>
                Many drinks have been called by this name, but this (seemingly simple) traditional Italian recipe is ...<br>
Ingredients<br>
Freshly ground espresso<br>
Cold milk<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my favourite lunch drinks, the delicious macchiato<br> A macchiato is essentially an espresso with the tiniest dollop of milk foam over it<br> In Italian, macchiato means stained or spotted, and this is exactly what we are doing to the espresso here: we are staining it with a little milk foam<br>

                The origin of the name is really quite interesting<br> It comes from baristas needing to show the waiters the difference between an espresso and an espresso with a little milk in it<br> So the latter was especially marked which became the macchiato<br>
                
                This idea can also be seen in places in Portugal where the name for the drink caf√© pintado means coffee with a drop<br> It's the same as a macchiato<br>
                
                You can ask for a macchiato which is a single espresso with a dollop of milk foam or a double macchiato which is a doppio (double espresso) with a dollop of milk foam<br> Just note that different baristas will have their own way of doing the macchiato<br> You will find some who add a dollop of steamed milk and a dollop of milk foam<br> It's all down to the training and individual preference<br>
