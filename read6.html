                Espresso is a coffee-making method which has its origins in Italy.<br> To make espresso you need a small amount of nearly boiling water forced under pressure through ground coffee beans.<br> You can get an espresso made with a variety of coffee beans and roasts.<br> What makes an espresso stand out is the fact that it has a thicker consistency and has a foamy cream on top.<br> Because of the pressurised brewing process, espresso is a lot more concentrated.<br>


Throughout the years, espresso became the base for all sort of types of coffee like latte, cappuccinos, macchiato, mocha or flat white.<br> The actual caffeine content of any coffee drinks varies based on size, bean origin and roast method.<br> Although espresso has a lot more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages, remember that a small serving of espresso has less caffeine content than a regular cup of coffee.<br>

To make espresso you will need an espresso machine.<br> It is believed that Angelo Moriondo, from Turin, created the first espresso machine in 1884.<br> Nowadays, you can get an espresso pretty much anywhere.<br> You can even get affordable espresso machines in your own home.<br>

To make espresso you just need one single shot of espresso in a cup.<br> That's all, nothing else added.<br>
