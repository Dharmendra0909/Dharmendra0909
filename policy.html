Please read this policy and our Mobile Terms and Conditions carefully; by using the App you confirm to have understood and agreed to them.
<br>
                Information we collect about you through the App We collect information about you when you:<br>
                
                *  register to use the App;<br>
                
                *  attempt to "check-in" to our store;<br>

                <span> Using your information</span> <br>
                
                Collecting personal information in the App (name, email address, date of birth) helps us to better understand what you need from us. We use your information to:
                <br>
                *  improve the functionality and performance of the App;<br>
                
                *  personalize our services to you;<br>
                
                *  tell you about important changes to the App and related services, and<br>
                
                *  manage promotions, competitions, customer surveys and questionnaires.<br>
                
                Your personal information is safe with us and will never be released to third party companies for their marketing purposes.
                
                The App captures your geographic location when you attempt to "check-in" to our store. We do this to allow you to pay using the app, and to provide an enhanced visit experience (for example, through digital loyalty cards). We will only capture this information with your consent.
                
                The App also captures basic usage metrics to help us identify any problems and to make improvements in the future. These metrics also help us understand how people use the App and how many people use the different functions within the App.
                
                Information We Capture<br>
                
                The list below summarizes what information the App captures, what we do with it and your choices:<br>
                
                <br>                - Geographic location<br>
                
                We provide enhanced shop visit experiences when you choose to "check-in" to our store, and allow you to pay using the App
                
                Your geographic location is not associated with any personally identifiable information
                
                You may prevent the App from accessing your device's location services, or turn off the location services of your Mobile Device. Doing so will impact the App and prevent you from enjoying an enhanced shop experience
                <br><br>
                - Data you share with us (Including information you give us when signing up, and information which is shared automatically such as Device ID, and IP address)
